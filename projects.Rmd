In my sophomore year, I developed a game called Frozen Bubbles with Zefan Qian and Yiyang Shi in Java. Paul Cantrell provided significant helps to us when we were developing. [Here](https://github.com/mac-comp127-f20-m1/Frozen-Bubble-Yeheng-Zefan-Yiyang) is the link to the github page of our Frozen Bubbles.


In my junior year, I did a project with Zhaoheng Li about non-parametric Bayes and its application in survival analysis. We received significant helps from Alicia Johnson. [Here](zhli12.github.io/dirichletmixturesurvival/) is the link to our bookdown.
